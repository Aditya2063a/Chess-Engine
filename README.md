# Chess-Engine


Chess Engine Development
Implemented a chess engine by following Eddie Sharick's structured tutorial series. Gained hands-on experience in algorithms such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning, and developed a strong understanding of chess logic, move generation, and evaluation functions. Integrated the engine into a graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive gameplay.
